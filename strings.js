// Our First String Variables Practice
// Please define the following string variables (you can use either let or const):
//
// bestColor should be set to the string purple (the best color on planet earth, as we all know);
//
// quote should be set to the string You had me at "hello" - be careful about quotation marks, we want double quotes inside the string.

let bestColor = 'purple';
let quote = 'You had me at "hello" ';

//QUIZ TIME
// Question 1:
// Given the following string:
//
//     const animal = "hippopotamus"
// Which character am I accessing?
//
//     animal[7]

// My answer: "t"

// Question 2:
// What is stored in the combo variable?
//
// const city = 'Kyoto';
// const country = 'Japan';
// const combo = city + country;

// My answer : "KyotoJapan"

// Question 3:
// What does the following return?
//
//     let year = "1998";
// year + 1;

//My answer: "19981"
